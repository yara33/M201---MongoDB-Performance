# M201 - MongoDB Performance

As you develop and operate applications with MongoDB, you may need to analyze the performance of the application and its database. When you encounter degraded performance, it is often a function of database access strategies, hardware availability, and the number of open database connections.

Some users may experience performance limitations as a result of inadequate or inappropriate indexing strategies, or as a consequence of poor schema design patterns.
